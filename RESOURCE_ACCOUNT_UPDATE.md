# Vault Resource Account Implementation

## What Changed

The multisig vault system has been upgraded to use **resource accounts** for secure fund management:

### Before (❌ Security Issue)
- Funds were stored in individual vault owner's accounts
- Each vault "balance" was just a number in the contract
- Withdrawals came from whoever's account had funds
- **Problem**: Funds could be accessed outside the multisig system

### After (✅ Secure Pool System)
- Each vault creates its own dedicated **resource account** (sub-account)
- All deposits go directly to this resource account
- Withdrawals can **only** happen through the multisig contract
- **Benefit**: Funds are truly locked and can only be accessed via multisig

## Key Features

### 1. **Dedicated Pool Account**
- Each vault gets a unique resource account address
- Address is deterministically generated: `vault_[vault_id]`
- Funds are **physically separated** from personal accounts

### 2. **Secure Fund Flow**
```
DEPOSIT:  User Wallet → Vault Resource Account
WITHDRAW: Vault Resource Account → Recipient (only via multisig approval)
```

### 3. **New Frontend Features**
- **Vault Pool Details** section showing:
  - Resource account address
  - Real-time balance from blockchain
  - Security confirmation message
- **Live Balance Updates** from the actual resource account
- **Transaction History** with correct source addresses

### 4. **New View Functions**
```move
// Get vault's resource account address and balance
get_vault_resource_account(vault_owner: address): (address, u64)
```

## Deployment Instructions

Since this is a **breaking change** (struct layout modified), you need to:

### Option 1: Fresh Deployment (Recommended for Testing)
```bash
# 1. Generate a new deployer account
aptos init --network testnet

# 2. Update .env with new addresses
# Copy the new address to VITE_MODULE_PUBLISHER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS

# 3. Update Move.toml 
# Change meena_add = "0x..." to your new address

# 4. Deploy the updated contract
aptos move publish --assume-yes

# 5. Initialize registry
cd scripts && node init_registry.mjs
```

### Option 2: Keep Current Setup (Data Loss)
If you want to keep the current deployer account, you'll lose existing vault data:
```bash
# The contract will error on upgrade due to struct changes
# You'd need to manually clear blockchain state (not recommended)
```

## Testing the New System

1. **Create a New Vault**
   - Creates a resource account automatically
   - Note the "Pool Address" in vault details

2. **Deposit Funds**
   - Funds go directly to the resource account
   - Check balance in "Vault Pool Details"

3. **Verify Security**
   - Try accessing the resource account directly (it won't work)
   - Only the vault contract can move funds out

4. **Check Transaction History**
   - All transactions now show correct source/destination
   - Resource account address appears in transaction records

## Benefits

✅ **True Fund Custody**: Funds are locked in isolated accounts
✅ **Transparent Addresses**: You can see exactly where funds are stored  
✅ **Enhanced Security**: No individual can access pooled funds
✅ **Blockchain Verifiable**: All fund movements are on-chain and auditable
✅ **Multi-vault Isolation**: Each vault has completely separate funds

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated contract to a test environment
2. Test the deposit/withdrawal flow
3. Verify resource account addresses and balances
4. Confirm transaction history accuracy
5. Once satisfied, deploy to your main environment

The new system provides **true multisig security** where funds are genuinely locked and can only be accessed through the proper multisig approval process.
