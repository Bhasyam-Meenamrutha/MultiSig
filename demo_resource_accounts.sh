echo "   2. Deploy updated contract with resource accounts"
echo "   3. Initialize registry and create new vaults"
echo "   4. See deposits go to actual resource account addresses"

echo "📱 Current Frontend Updates (Ready for New Contract):"
echo "   ✅ Vault Pool Details section added"
echo "   ✅ Resource account balance display"
echo "   ✅ getVaultResourceAccount() function"
echo "   ✅ Enhanced transaction history UI"
